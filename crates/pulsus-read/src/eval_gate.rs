//! `EvalGate` — a process-wide bounded permit gating the one place the
//! read path offloads CPU-bound work onto tokio's blocking pool:
//! `MetricsEngine::query_inner` → `evaluate_offloaded` →
//! `spawn_blocking(pulsus_promql::evaluate)` (issue #101, hardening
//! follow-up to #93). The permit is acquired **after** the ClickHouse
//! fetch has fully drained into owned `SeriesData` and the owned permit is
//! moved **into** the `spawn_blocking` closure, so it is released only when
//! the blocking eval truly finishes — bounding in-flight evals *including*
//! evals for already-disconnected clients (tokio does not cancel a running
//! `spawn_blocking`; that is precisely why the bound matters).
//!
//! **Scope:** this gate covers only `pulsus_promql::evaluate`, the sole
//! production `spawn_blocking` eval. LogQL / TraceQL / trace-search
//! evaluation run inline on the reactor today (no `spawn_blocking`), so
//! there is nothing to bound there; gating them would first require
//! offloading them — a separate issue.
//!
//! **Exhaustion is a bounded wait**, not a fail-fast rejection: a caller
//! past the limit `acquire().await`s and queues, bounded by the existing
//! per-request `TimeoutLayer` (408, `query_timeout`). This deliberately
//! differs from the tail slot's fail-fast `try_acquire_owned`/`429` (a tail
//! holds its slot for the connection's whole lifetime; an eval permit for
//! ~hundreds of ms), so there is no new 429/503 status and no new timeout
//! knob.
//!
//! **Query-perf mandate:** the uncontended path is a single lock-free
//! `try_acquire_owned` — no clock, no atomic, no waker — so a query that
//! runs concurrently today under the (generous) limit is never serialized
//! or slowed. The wait instrumentation lives strictly on the contended
//! slow path.
